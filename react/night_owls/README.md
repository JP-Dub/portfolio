Welcome to Night Owls
=========================

Nightlife coordination app written with *React.js* and using the *Yelp Fusion* and *Twitter* API

Users can see which places are RSVP'd and how many. Authenticated users can RSVP ahead of time with a single click to join and another to cancel. Authenticated users' sessions are saved so when you login, the last location you were viewing will be restored.

To see a visual representation of this app in action type **demo** in the search bar. In a real-world environment all RSVP's are cleared daily, though I've coded for this feature the *Glitch* servers are put to sleep after some inactivity and therefore the code is unable to execute as it's programmed.

If you're searching with an empty input value, your browser will attempt to auto-detect your location using the *Geolocation* API, providing you haven't blocked geolocation requests for this site.
