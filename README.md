============================

This is a portfolio of small projects I designed to showcase some of the skills I have developed since graduating from the online bootcamp hosted by **freeCodeCamp**. The ideas were originally inspired from projects I previously undertook where the skills being learned were  implemented in a list of directives that had to be met in order to pass. In the aftermath of bootcamp, my creativity has been unleashed and I've expanded on previous projects to streamline, re-write or learn entirely new ways to developing web apps and breathing new life into former work. Just because I'm not in school anymore doesn't mean I've stopped learning.
